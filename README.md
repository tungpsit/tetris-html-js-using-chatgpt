# Tetris Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows you to control falling tetrominoes (shapes made up of four squares) and stack them to create complete rows. When a row is complete, it is cleared, and the player earns points. The goal is to prevent the stack of tetrominoes from reaching the top of the game board.

## Features

- Interactive gameplay with keyboard controls.
- Random generation of different tetromino shapes.
- Automatic movement of tetrominoes downwards.
- Detection and removal of completed rows.
- Score tracking.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. The game board will be displayed, and a tetromino will start falling from the top.
3. Use the arrow keys to move the tetromino left, right, or down. Press the up arrow key to rotate the tetromino.
4. Aim to stack the tetrominoes neatly to create complete rows.
5. When a row is complete, it will be cleared, and you will earn points.
6. The game ends if the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the game board.

## Development
